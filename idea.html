        <h4>Overview:</h4>


    For my project I would like to delve into creating an app. The idea would be to
     make an app that could serve as a to-do list and a reminder for university
      activities as outlined in my personality test, I often struggle with keeping
       up to date with projects and deadlines. The app could be created through CSS,
       html and java or it could be made through an app development software as I am new
        to doing this and may need assistance with creating it. The app should send
        notifications of up coming tasks and it will have a completed tab for tasks that
         have been completed by the user.

      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>Motivation:</h4>

‘Around 1.3 million people were studying at higher
 education institutions, while 489,000 were studying
  at technical and further education (TAFE) institutions,
   and 895,000 were at schools and over two thirds of these
   students are studying fulltime in Australia as of
    May 2021.’ Because of this I believe if done right,
     the application could serve as a very useful tool
      for many students in Australia and around the
       world. This application could serve to help
        me personally as I currently have struggles with
         keeping up to date and staying on top of my
          tasks while at university.

    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Description:</h4>

This application will serve to help students compartmentalize their studies workload
 into sections and allow them to tick things off as completed as time goes by in their
 course. They can also choose to add other tasks from their everyday life if they wish. Because of this the mobile smartphone application will need a coherent user-friendly way of splitting task up into subcategory’s meaning the application will have separate window entities to show these categories. For the application to be much more effective it will need its own push notification system that sends notifications to the user to alert them of upcoming deadlines and due dates for assignments. In order to meet these functions demands the system will ask for suer input details
 such as due dates and deadlines and depending on the date the application will send
  alerts with an amount of time left till its due. This could be done 2 weeks before
   somethings is due and then everyday when it is closer to the due date. The system
    could also display a short summary of what is needed to be completed before the
     project reaches its completion. This will act as a check list for the task to help
      split the task up and create a way for students to better track their progress
       through an assignment and only once all minor tsks displayed in the assignment are
        done can a task be put into the completion page. Students can also choose to add
         more detail on the task to help them truly understand what they are required to
          do before they go ahead and start on a task. With this application it will need
           a fluent and cohesive user design so good CSS will allow for the application
            to have a clear
      and aesthetic look and the Java will allow for animations such as the ability to
       drag, drop and check off features. There should also be a very small window that
       shows upcoming assignments within the applications main screen to better help students see what is required of them at their current time within their studies. This window could be displayed as a small window in the top corner of the page. Something else that would aid in the tracking of deadlines for students would be
      a progress bar that could be done within Java and as they tick off task for
       assignments the bar progresses up in percentage.

  </p>
  <br>
  <h4>Tools and Technologies: </h4>

To complete this task of creating a student help application
 a computer and smart phone will be required as the application
  will be written with code on the computer and the phone will
   display and run the application. The software required will be
    Github as that allows programmers to work together on a project
     and see the changes that each other are making. The last thing
      that is required is a text editor of some sort to write the
       code such as Atom, Visual Studio or even just windows own text editor.

</p>
<br>
<h4>Skills Required:  </h4>
In order to successfully complete this task, I will
 need to have a good understanding of CSS, HTML and
  HTML if I am to code the application myself. Thus,
   making this feasible as although I am not a programming
    student, I have a basic understanding of coding so
     therefore I will have a good starting point, thus
      making this feasible as I only need to then expand
       on what I already know. The idea also doesn’t
        require elaborate hardware as it only needs a phone
         and a computer of some kind to write the code.

</p>
<br>
<h4>Outcome:  </h4>
If the project is a success than the original issues of new or
 current students with a busy lifestyle struggling to manage
  all the task that life and university bring them will be
   solved. This will be solved as the application will allow
    for students to have their responsibilities and task split
     up into software that will send them notifications when
      things need to be done. By having the application, a
      sperate entity to things such as a list on their phone
      allows the user to better distinguish that the app is there
       to help with their work and study responsibilities.
